# Multi-Threaded HTTP Server in Node.js

This project demonstrates a multi-threaded HTTP server built using Node.js and the `worker_threads` module. It processes incoming requests concurrently using a pool of workers, improving performance for CPU-intensive tasks.

## Features
- Multi-threaded architecture using Node.js worker threads.
- Basic routing and dynamic responses based on request URL.
- Handles GET requests with basic routing (`/`, `/info`, `/health`).
- Scalable to handle higher concurrency through worker thread pooling.

## Requirements
- Node.js (>= v12.0)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (my url)
  cd (my rep )
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node src/server.js
   ```

4. Alternatively, you can use the shell script to start the server:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start.sh
   ```

5. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser or use `curl` to test the server.

## Routes
- `/`: A welcome message.
- `/info`: Information about the server.
- `/health`: Health check message.
- `/unknown`: Will respond with "Not Found" for any unrecognized routes.

## Testing

To test the server, you can use Mocha or any other testing framework. The following tests are available:
- Respond to `GET /` with a welcome message.
- Respond to `GET /health` with a health message.
- Respond to unknown routes with a "Not Found" message.

To run the tests:
1. Make sure your server is not running.
2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Configuration

The server configuration, such as the number of worker threads and the port number, can be found in the `config/config.js` file.

Example config:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  PORT: 3000,
  NUM_WORKERS: require('os').cpus().length,  // Number of CPU cores
};
```
